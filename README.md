# Exercise-1

Exercise of Marcos Pacheco C++ course in Udemy.
The objective is to print the message "I'll learn to code in C++ language" on the screen of the Windows shell.
I didn't notice GitHub commit messages were in Portuguese because Visual Studio Community 2022 was in this language, so I switched it to English. 
The next projects will be all 100% in English.
